## How it works â€” App.jsx (full file)


Explanation (beginner-friendly)
- useState hooks: store input (city), fetched weather, errors and loading flag.
- handleFetchWeather:
  - Validate input; show message if empty.
  - Call Nominatim to turn a city name into latitude/longitude.
  - If no geocode result -> show "City not found."
  - Call Openâ€‘Meteo with the coordinates to get current_weather.
  - Save the result into state so React re-renders the UI.
  - Errors are caught and shown to the user; loading toggles to keep UX clear.

Line-by-line explanation:

   - Checks if the user entered a city name â€” if not, shows an error.
   - Resets old data and activates the loading state.
   - Calls Nominatim API to get latitude & longitude of the city.
   - If no results are found, displays an error message.
   - Calls Open-Meteo API using the coordinates to get real-time weather data.
   - Updates the weather state so the UI can re-render with new information.
   - If an error occurs at any point, itâ€™s caught and displayed to the user.

## Styling â€” App.css (key parts)

Notes on styling:
- Uses subtle translucent card with blur for a modern feel.
- Mobile-first responsive rules stack input and button on small screens.

## APIs used
- Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) â€” geocoding: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search
  - free, no API key; respect usage policies and add user-agent in production.
- Openâ€‘Meteo â€” weather: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
  - free current_weather parameter returns temperature, windspeed, time.

Tip: For production, set request headers with a descriptive User-Agent when calling Nominatim and respect rate limits.
